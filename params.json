Only a JavaScript editor and HTTP PUT requests.","body":"nocms: transform your browser into a website editor\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\n[Demo](https://rawgit.com/mildred/nocms/howling-mad/page-xhtml.html) (would work\r\nif github could serve raw files with any content type, if only with a query\r\nstring `?content-type=text/html`, and followed submodules).\r\n\r\nProject goals:\r\n\r\n- create a HTML WYSIWYG/M editor in JavaScript that run in your browser\r\n- do not require server-side specific code. This should run on any dumb HTTP\r\n  server that allow write access using PUT queries. In the long term, this\r\n  should allow hosting on a webserver implementing the ipns distributed\r\n  filesystem.\r\n- be powerful enough to create a blog. Create new pages / posts. Aggregate them\r\n  to the main page (using the `<link>` tag) and let the main page generate\r\n  seamless `<iframes>` for each post we have.\r\n- do not require JavaScript for normal users (not using the editor). XSLT can be\r\n  used instead to aggregate posts in the front page. This improve the user's\r\n  privacy.\r\n- This should also allow for user comments. Comments would be standalone pages\r\n  hosted on the comment author's namespace on ipns. The comment would contain a\r\n  link to the original article, and would publish a backlink using some global\r\n  mechanism.\r\n- Comments could be displayed on the original article the following ways:\r\n    - the original article's author validates comments manually and put a\r\n      backlink (`<link rev>`) on the article `<head>`, and use a XSLT stylesheet\r\n      to generate iframes on the page body to show comments.\r\n    - use of JavaScript (unfortunately) to query the distributed backlink\r\n      storage and show the comments\r\n    - use a browser extension for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
